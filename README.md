# APIs

Udacity course [Designing RESTful APIs](https://www.udacity.com/course/designing-restful-apis--ud388)


## Introduction

### Why take this course

A crucial skill for a back-end or full-stack web developer is the ability to make applications that are easily accessible and understood for other developers. Mobile developers, front-end developers and other back-end and full-stack developers all rely on API endpoints to enhance the functionality of their applications.


### Repository

This code base was meant to supplement the Udacity course for designing RESTful APIs.  Within each directory you will find sample and solution code to the exercises in this course.  Some of this code will require some modification from the user before it is executable on your machine.


## Course lessons

1. **Whats and whys of APIs**
2. **Accessing published APIs: Google Maps and Foursquare**
3. **Creating your own API endpoints with Flask**
4. **Securing your API**
5. **Writing developer-friendly APIs**

### API Keys for third party providers

This course uses the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs. You will need to create developer accounts and private keys in order to properly use code snippets that rely on these APIs.


### Python modules

To see a list of locally installed Python modules from the command line:

```text
