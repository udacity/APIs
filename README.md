# APIs
### This is the code Repo for ud388 - Designing RESTful APIs

This code base was meant to supplement the Udacity course for designing RESTful APIs.  Within each directory you will find sample and solution code to the exercises in this course.  Some of this code will require some modification from the user before it is executable on your machine.

## API Keys for third party providers
This course uses the Google Maps and Foursquare APIs. You will need to create developer accounts and private keys in order to properly use code snippets that rely on these APIs.

## Python Libraries
The code in this repository assumes the following python libraries are installed:
* Flask
* SQLAlchemy
* httplib
* requests
* oauth2client
* redis
* passlib
* itsdangerous
* flask-httpauth

## Installing Redis
      wget http://download.redis.io/redis-stable.tar.gz
      tar xvzf redis-stable.tar.gz
      cd redis-stable
      make install
